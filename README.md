# show-websites-in-iframe

2 important points to consider:

1. What are the sites that do not allow, then click on the browser console to check the errors and investigate.

2. When you want to display a site with iframe, you must have permission to do this. Some allow this by default, but some do not, so why?

Explanation of security headers related to iframes:

ðŸŽ¯ X-Frame-Options:
It is an HTTP header that tells the browser whether it is allowed to display a web page inside an iframe or not.

ðŸŽ¯ :Content-Security-Policy (CSP) - frame-ancestors
It is a newer and more powerful header that specifies multiple security policies.

ðŸ’¯ Why are these headers important?

Preventing Clickjacking Attacks: If a site allows an iframe to be displayed anywhere without restrictions, someone may load its page on a malicious site and trick users into clicking on malicious buttons, for example, to control security and protect user privacy.
